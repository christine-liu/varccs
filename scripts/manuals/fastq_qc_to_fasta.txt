FASTQ Quality Control to FASTA 

Description:

	Perform quality control on the PacBio Circular Consensus FASTQ files.

Usage:

	fastq_qc_to_fasta 
		-i filename.fastq
		[options]

Mandatory arguments:

	-i filename.fastq or --input filename.fastq
		filename.fastq is the input CCS FASTQ filename obtained from PacBio.

The following [options] are available:

	-p output_prefix or --prefix output_prefix
		Output filenames will star with this "output_prefix". Can include full path.
		If not given, output prefix is automatically generated from the input file, e.g.
		if the input file is /path/to/filename.fastq, output_prefix will be
		/path/to/filename, and all output files generated by will be of a form:
		/path/to/filename_*.*

	--do-quality-filtering 0,1
		0 = do NOT quality filter
		1 = do quality filter
		Filters FASTQ reads using average quality scores threshold specified by --qs_ath.
		Default: 1

	--do-homopolymer-run-filtering 0,1
		0 = do NOT filter homopolymer runs starting with a low quality score
		1 = do filter homopolymer runs starting with a low quality score
		Homopolymer runs (such as AAAAA...) whose first nucleotide has a quality
		score is strictly below a certain threshold are converted to "AN". The quality
		score threshold is specified by --qs_hth and the minimum homopolymer run length
		by --run_hth.
		Default: 1

	--do-pcr-alignment-filtering 0,1
		0 = do NOT filter out reads 
		1 = do filter out reads
		Filters out (or not) reads which do not match both PCR primer sequences. The FASTA
		file with PCR primers is specified using -m or --primers (see those options for
		details on preparing this FASTA file). PCR primers are aligned using `blastn`,
		which needs to be installed and accessible through $PATH, using word size
		specified in --pb_ws. For each orientation (5'-3' and 3'-5'), this step aligns 
		both forward and reverse primers to the read and filters out the read if no
		alignment was found within 

	--qs_ath integer
		Filter out reads with average quality score equal to or less than this number.
		Default: 85

	--qs_hth integer
		Quality score threshold; see --do-homopolymer-run-filtering.
		Default: 30

	--run_hth integer
		Minimum homopolymer run length; see --do-homopolymer-run-filtering.
		Default: 2

	-m filename.fasta or --primers filename.fasta
		filename.fasta = FASTA file with PCR primers with the following exact structure:
		>forward_5to3
		ATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGCA
		>forward_3to5
		TGCCAAACCGGGCAGCAT
		>reverse_5to3
		CAAGTTCTTTGAGCAGATGCAGAACTAG
		>reverse_3to5
		CTAGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAACTTG

	--pb_off integer
		Maximum allowed offset in nucleotides to the beginning of the PCR primer
		alignment for either end of the read; see --do-pcr-alignment-filtering for 
		details.
		Default: 150

	--pb_ws integer|auto
		Word size in nucleotides for PCR primer BLAST filtering alignment step. If set 
		to "auto" (without quotes), the word size used is 3/4 of the length of the
		shortest of the two primers.
		Default: auto

	--del-intermediate-files 0,1
		0 = do NOT delete intermediate files used in each step, useful for debugging
		1 = do delete intermediate files
		Default: 1

	--del-filtered-reads 0,1
		0 = do NOT delete FASTA file with reads failed PCR alignment step
		1 = do delete FASTA file with reads failed PCR alignment step
		This filename will be named as:
		prefix_filtered_qsXX_hpf_qsXX_repX_unique_primerblasted_wsauto_filtered.fasta
		Default: 1
